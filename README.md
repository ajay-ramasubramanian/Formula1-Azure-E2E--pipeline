# End to End Formula1 Data Engineering project with Azure Databricks 

## Project Overview

This project presents the creation of a seamless data pipeline on Azure, orchestrated with PySpark, Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Azure Databricks, and Azure Data Factory. The pipeline guides data through its transformation from the raw bronze stage to the refined gold layer, utilizing incremental loading and establishing external tables for in-depth analytics. At its core, Delta Lake, an open-source storage layer, guarantees ACID transactions and efficient metadata management.
